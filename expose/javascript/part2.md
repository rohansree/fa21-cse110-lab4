1. 3
   At line 12, "3" prints. 3 is the var that iterates through the array, and there are 3 elements in the array.
2. 150
   At line 13, "150" prints. The discounted price is half of the element in the array that is sent in, and the last element that is checked is 300. Half of 300 is 150, so 150 is printed.
3. 150
   At line 14, "150" prints. The value of 150 is multiplied by 100 and rounded to the nearest integer, and then divided by 100, yielding 150 again.
4. [50,100,150]
   The initial array sent in is [100, 200, 300]. The for loop iterates through the area, and adds prices that are 50% of the original values into discounted. Discounted is then returned, so it will return these values.
5. The code has an error.
   i is a let, and is only defined within the block of the for loop. Attempting to access it outside the block will throw an error.
6. The code has an error.
   discountedPrice is a let, and is only defined within the block of the for loop. Attempting to access it outside the block will throw an error.
7. 150
   At line 14, "150" prints. The value of 150 is multiplied by 100 and rounded to the nearest integer, and then divided by 100, yielding 150 again. The let is defined within the same block as this print statement, so there will not be an error.
8. [50,100,150]
   The initial array sent in is [100, 200, 300]. The for loop iterates through the area, and adds prices that are 50% of the original values into discounted. Discounted is then returned, so it will return these values. The return statement is within the same block as the let, so it will be able to access the value without an error.
9. The code has an error.
   i is a let, and is only defined within the block of the for loop. Attempting to access it outside the block will throw an error.
10. 3.
    The length of the array prices is 3 when the const is initialized. The value of a const cannot change, so the statemement will print 3.
11. [50,100,150]
    Const means the variable cannot be reassigned, but it can be manipulated. So, pushing new variables to the array discounted will work, and 50, 100, and 150 will be pushed to it.
